Ben Coomes
CPSC 3300
HW2
03/23/16

Description: 

The script ben_coomes_hw2 reads in MIPS-like instructions until an empty line
is entered. Once an empty line is entered, the previously typed instructions 
are used to build a chart that shows thier progression through a 5 - stage
pipeline. 


Notes: 

The script is divided into 4 parts, each of which was a seperate source file
when I was building the program. I merged the files for convienence. 

The script can be exectued as follows: 

$ python ben_coomes_hw2.py < inputfile.txt

or by 

$ python ben_coomes_hw2.py

followed by the desired instructions, then a newline.
